# 🚀 Multi-User Role-Based System – Laravel Project

This project is a **Multi-User Web Application** developed using the **Laravel PHP Framework**. It was built during my internship at **Webito Infotech** from scratch and is designed to handle multiple types of users in a single system. It includes a full authentication system, secure login/signup flow, and role-based access features that help control what each user can see or do. The system follows clean coding practices and uses Laravel’s native features like Middleware, Policies, and Blade templates. This project helped me understand how to build scalable and secure applications with modern PHP practices.

## 📌 Project Features

- ✅ Built from Scratch using Laravel Framework
- 🔐 Fully Functional **Login/Signup Authentication Module**
- 👥 Supports **Three Different User Types** (e.g., Admin, Manager, Regular User)
- ⚙️ Role & Permission management using Laravel policies/middleware
- 🎯 Clean code structure and scalable architecture
- 📊 Blade-based UI integration with user dashboards
- 🔐 Password encryption & session-based access control
- 🧪 Tested locally during internship with staging-level stability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP Framework)  
- **Frontend:** Blade Templating, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Authentication:** Laravel Auth scaffolding  
- **Role Management:** Laravel Middleware / Gates & Policies  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## 👤 Admin / User Role Logic

| User Role | Permissions & Access |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Admin** | Can manage all users, roles, permissions, and see system-wide data |
| **Manager** | Can manage assigned users, view dashboards, and edit specific data |
| **User** | Can only access personal dashboard and limited features |

Each role is assigned using middleware and validated during routing and session handling.

## 📘 Laravel Framework Resources

Laravel makes development easy and enjoyable with expressive syntax and strong features. Here are some official learning resources:
